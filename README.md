#mIPython 

Do some fun analysis on your histortical IPython commands!

## To Run:

1. Edit the `mipython.py` file to use your `IPYTHON_HOME`.
2. From the command line, not the IPython Shell, run the `mipython.py` file. The program will go through the sqlite database that IPython uses to store all your commands and print out some neat summaries and recommendations.
